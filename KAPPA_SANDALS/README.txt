task: add a Logo image for product
created an image using copilot
saved image as .jpg using paint
Located images folder
copied and pasted image in wwwroot/Images folder
using file explorer
appended the view file Index.cshtml to include logo
command used
<img src="/Images/sandal.jpg" alt="Company Logo" width="300" height="200" style="float: left; />
Didn't like the way it looked
so I wanted to center it
<center>
<img src="/Images/sandal.jpg" alt="Company Logo" width="300" height="200" />
</center>
Looked nice

Ask checked on Github me and Anand both are unable to change the group permissions to private because we have only clone permissions not the owner permissions,
